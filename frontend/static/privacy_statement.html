        The personal data collected and processed by us can be divided into two
        general data categories: User Data and Usage Data. User Data User Data
        is personal data collected directly from you or from our customer
        organization on behalf of which you are using the Hexeats Services
        (“Customer Organization”), as the case may be. We may collect User Data
        from our Users and Customer Organizations in a variety of ways,
        including after the conclusion of a service agreement with the Customer
        Organization or when Users register for the Hexeats Services, subscribe
        to a newsletter, or fill out a form. Further, please note that we also
        collect details of any transactions and payments you carry out through
        the Hexeats Services. User Data Necessary to Use the Hexeats Services
        The following personal data collected and processed by us is necessary
        for the proper performance of the contract between you and us, as well
        as for our legitimate interest while fulfilling our contractual
        obligations towards our Customer Organizations and for compliance with
        our legal obligations: Full name Telephone number Email address
        Information relating to your payment instrument(s), such as the number
        of your payment instrument(s) and the expiration date of your payment
        instrument(s) (required for ordering food and other products via the
        Hexeats Services, but not stored by Hexeats, as Hexeats uses a
        third-party payment service provider for processing payments). User Data
        You Provide Voluntarily Your user or customer experience may be enhanced
        by providing us with the following information: A picture Delivery
        address Location data (if you consent to the processing of your location
        data) Partner-specific bonus card or participation in other loyalty
        programs, if applicable in your country Age (when ordering
        age-restricted goods) Other information you provide when creating or
        modifying your account profile. Other Information We may also process
        other information provided by you voluntarily, such as: Information
        related to your orders from Hexeats or through Hexeats Services (e.g.,
        items purchased, special instructions, date and time of order, total
        amount of order, and other order history). Information you provide when
        submitting ratings, comments, or responding to surveys. Favorite
        restaurants or merchants and other preferences. Marketing opt-ins and
        opt-outs. Information you provide by phone, email, or chat
        correspondence with us, including call recordings of your calls with our
        customer service. In addition to User Data collected from you and the
        Customer Organization, we process certain personal data provided by
        third-party service providers about you. For example, for corporate
        customers, we may process company contact person information to enable
        communication and marketing with the company, as well as managing the
        customer relationship. Such data is primarily obtained from public
        sources such as local trade registers, companies providing this type of
        information services, or the companies themselves. If your order
        contains products or services that may imply a health condition or other
        sensitive (special category) personal data, Hexeats needs to process
        this data to provide the Hexeats Services to you. In addition to the
        contents of the order, this may also include, for example, medical
        prescription data in the case of prescription medicine. Hexeats adheres
        to any additional safeguards that may apply to processing such personal
        data under applicable laws and regulations. If required under applicable
        laws, Hexeats will ask for separate consent for processing such personal
        data, and you may withdraw such consent at any time through your profile
        settings or by contacting Hexeats support at support@hexeats.com. If you
        connect or log in to your account with Facebook, Facebook shares with us
        personal information about you, such as your profile picture, a sample
        of your Facebook friends, and your Facebook ID. While Hexeats maintains
        its page on Facebook, both Hexeats and Facebook are joint controllers
        for your personal data. More information on the processing of personal
        data on Facebook is available at Meta Privacy Policy. Usage Data Usage
        Data arises from User interactions with the Hexeats Services. Although
        we do not normally use Usage Data to identify you as an individual, you
        can in certain circumstances be identified from it, either alone or when
        combined or linked with User Data. In such situations, Usage Data can
        also be considered personal data under applicable laws, and we will
        treat such data as personal data. We may automatically collect the
        following Usage Data when you visit or interact with the Hexeats
        Services: Information that describes your device or browser and Hexeats’
